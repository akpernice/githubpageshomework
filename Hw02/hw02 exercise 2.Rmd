```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I chose the 'chickwts' dataset to explore. The two varialbes I am exploring are the chicken's weight, and type of feed. 
```{r exercise 2}
summary(chickwts)
```

Below is a scatterplot of chicken weight by type of feed. As you can see, the heaviest chickens feed on sunflowers, casein, and meatmeal. 

```{r}
chickwts
  ggplot(chickwts, (aes(weight, feed))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_bw()
```
Below is a distribution of chicken weights. It is pretty much a normal distribution. 
```{r}
ggplot(chickwts, aes(weight)) +
  geom_density()

```
