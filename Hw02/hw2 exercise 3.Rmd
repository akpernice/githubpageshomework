Below is a scatterplot of a car's horse power/ miles per gallon. As you can see, the more miles per gallon, the lower the horse power of the vehicle. 
```{r exercise 3}
mtcars
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_x_log10("Miles per Gallon") +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Horse Power")


```
